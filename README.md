# Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Course Neighborhood Map Project

This React.js App is a single page App. It dispplays a customized Google Map displaying my favorite resorts to walk through on my tour of the Las Vegas Strip. There is an options sidebar that allows the user to filter the Markers on the map. Clicking on a map marker will display an InfoWindow, where you have the option of display ing Flickr photos from that resort.
