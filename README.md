# Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Course Neighborhood Map Project

This React.js App is a single page App. It dispplays a customized Google Map displaying my favorite resorts to walk through on my tour of the Las Vegas Strip. There is an options sidebar that allows the user to filter the Markers on the map. Clicking on a map marker will display an InfoWindow, where you have the option of display ing Flickr photos from that resort.

## Create-React-App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Directions

1. This App was created with 'create-react-app'
2. On the command line, navigate to the project root folder and 'npm install'
3. You will need to install npm serve globally to run the production build.
    * On the command line run 'npm install -g serve'
    * On the command line run 'react-scripts build'
    * On the command line run 'serve -s build'
    * **Note you have previously run a production build, you may need to clear your browswer cache to see the changes made in the dev build**
4. On the command line, navigate to the projects root folder and 'npm start'
5. The console will tell you what port to use, usually localhost:5000 
6. Navigate your browser to that address and the App will run.
7. To run the dev build, simply run 'npm start' after step 2
    * **Note: The dev version will NOT have a service worker to cache the site**
